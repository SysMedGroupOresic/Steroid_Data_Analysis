  Here are two Shiny widgets
```{r echo = FALSE}
selectInput("n_breaks",
            label = "Number of bins:",
            choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50),
            selected = 20)
sliderInput("bw_adjust",
            label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
            min = 0.2,
            max = 2,
            value = 1,
            step = 0.2)

```
And here is a histogram
```{r echo = FALSE}
renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$eruptions,
       probability = TRUE,
       breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Duration (minutes)",
       main = "Geyser eruption duration")
  dens <- density(faithful$eruptions,
                  adjust = input$bw_adjust)
  lines(dens,
        col = "blue")
})
```
