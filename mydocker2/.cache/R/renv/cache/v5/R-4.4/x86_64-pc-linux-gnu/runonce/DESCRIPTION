Package: runonce
Title: Run Once and Save Result
Version: 0.2.3
Authors@R: person("Florian", "Privé", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "florian.prive.21@gmail.com")
Description: Package 'runonce' helps automating the saving of long-running code to help running the same code multiple times. If you run some long-running  code once, it saves the result in a file on disk. Then, if the result  already exists, i.e. if the code has already been run and its output has  already been saved, it just reads the result from the stored file instead  of running the code again.
