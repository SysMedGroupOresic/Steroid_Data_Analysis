This package provides a local copy of metadata schemas for various Bioconductor objects
such as the [`SummarizedExperiment`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SummarizedExperiment),
the [`SingleCellExperiment`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleCellExperiment),
different types of [`DelayedArray`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DelayedArray)s, etc.
It is intended for use by other packages in the **alabaster** framework
such as [_alabaster.base_](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/alabaster.base).
Readers are advised to check out the more human-friendly format [here](https://ArtifactDB.github.io/BiocObjectSchemas).
