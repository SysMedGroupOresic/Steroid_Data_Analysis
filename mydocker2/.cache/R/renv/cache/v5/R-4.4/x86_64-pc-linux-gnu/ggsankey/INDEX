geom_sankey             geom_sankey Creates a sankey plot which
                        visualize flows between nodes. Each observation
                        needs to have a 'x' aesthetic as well as a
                        'next_x' column which declares where that
                        observation should flow. Also each observation
                        should have a 'node' and a 'next_node'
                        aesthetic which provide information about which
                        group in the y-direction. By default each row
                        of the data frame is counted to calculate the
                        size of flows. A manual flow value can be added
                        with the 'value' aesthetic.
