Description: 
    Implements utilities for installation of the basilisk package, primarily 
    for creation of the underlying Conda instance. This allows us to
    avoid re-writing the same R code in both the configure script (for
    centrally administered R installations) and in the lazy installation
    mechanism (for distributed package binaries). It is highly unlikely that developers
    - or, heaven forbid, end-users! - will need to interact with this package
    directly; they should be using the basilisk package instead.
