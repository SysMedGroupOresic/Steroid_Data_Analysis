Description: 
    Installs a self-contained conda instance that is managed by the R/Bioconductor installation machinery.
    This aims to provide a consistent Python environment that can be used reliably by Bioconductor packages.
    Functions are also provided to enable smooth interoperability of multiple Python environments in a single R session.
