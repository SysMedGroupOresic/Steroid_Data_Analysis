Description: Functions to convert a page of plots drawn with the  'graphics' package into identical output drawn with the 'grid' package. The result looks like the original 'graphics'-based plot, but consists of 'grid' grobs and viewports that can then be manipulated with  'grid' functions (e.g., edit grobs and revisit viewports).
