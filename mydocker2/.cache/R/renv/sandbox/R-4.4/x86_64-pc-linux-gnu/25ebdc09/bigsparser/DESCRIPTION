Title: Sparse Matrix Format with Data on Disk
Version: 0.7.3
Authors@R: person(given = "Florian", family = "Privé", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "florian.prive.21@gmail.com")
Description: Provide a sparse matrix format with data stored on disk, to be used in both R and C++. This is intended for more efficient use of sparse  data in C++ and also when parallelizing, since data on disk does not need copying. Only a limited number of features will be implemented. For now, conversion can be performed from a 'dgCMatrix' or a 'dsCMatrix' from R  package 'Matrix'. A new compact format is also now available.
